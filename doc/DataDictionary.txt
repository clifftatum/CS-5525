*************************************************************
The 3 SS (Slow Stochastic) signals trigger on SlowPctD and SlowPctK values.

The theory is that once both values remain over 80 or below 20 for 3 consecutive days that name is no longer oversold\overbought.  It will press upward (over 80) or downward (below 20) until one line breaches the 80\20 range.

Once the breach occurs the price will move to the 20 day moving average.

Once it is in these extreme ranges a crossover will preced the 80\20 breach.
